## The problem with LaTeX templates

Practically every journal supplying a LaTeX template defines its own custom macros for author affiliations and other metadata, with very little consistency from one publisher to another. This renders the process of re-submitting a manuscript to a new journal really cumbersome. Consider the following two examples:

**OSA**
```{tex OSA, eval=FALSE}
\title{Manuscript Title}

\author[1,2,3]{Author One}
\author[2,*]{Author Two}

\affil[1]{First address}
\affil[2]{Second address}
\affil[3]{Third address}

\affil[*]{Corresponding author: email@my-email.com}
\dates{Compiled \today}
\ociscodes{(140.3490) Lasers, distributed feedback; (060.2420) Fibers.}
```

**ACS**
```{tex ACS, eval=FALSE}
\title{Manuscript title}

\author{Author One}
\affiliation{First address}
\alsoaffiliation{Second address}
\email{email@my-email.com}

\author{Author Two} 
\phone{+123456789}
\fax{+123456789}
\email{email@my-email.com}
\affiliation{First address}
\alsoaffiliation{Second address}
\alsoaffiliation{Third address}

\abbreviations{IR,NMR,UV}
\keywords{American Chemical Society}
```

## A standardised, human-readable format

We'll store the metadata in an external file, in `yaml` format.


```{bash md, warning=FALSE,  message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
cat _metadata.yaml
```

This file can contain more information than needed, and is common to all versions of the manuscript, regardless of the publisher's template. From these data, we will populate the TeX macros relevant to a given LaTeX template as needed.

Below's an example to illustrate the process.

```{r test, warning=FALSE,  message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("preview.png")
```

## TODO list

- use better fake names, phones etc. with charlatan package https://github.com/ropensci/charlatan
- compile a list of LaTeX templates
- turn them into glue templates
- fine-tune the glueing process (line breaks, missing values, strange characters, etc.)
- wrap into a package (cf Rticles)
- make a Rstudio add-in
- figure out where this fits in the rmarkdown + pandoc templates side of things (need to inject a R-processed `$meta-header$` into the template, but before knitting -- somewhat incompatible with a single pass?)
- consider alternative languages (Haskell, javascript, TeX seem obvious candidates)
